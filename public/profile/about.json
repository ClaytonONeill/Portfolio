  "about": "Hello!  My name is Clay O'Neill, a Web Developer from Maryland.\n\n\nI have four years of development experience having gained an interest in computer programming a little later on in life. Previously, I had spent most of my time studying audio engineering and working as a musician. I have always enjoyed problem solving and puzzles so the transition into the world of computer science was as exciting as it was challenging! I am currently employed as a Full Stack web developer and am also a full time CS student. In my off time, I enjoy cuddling with my two rescue Pitbullâ€™s, cooking up new vegan recipes, and bothering my wife whenever possible. Thank you for checking out my portfolio!",
