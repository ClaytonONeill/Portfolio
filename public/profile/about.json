  "about": "Hello!  My name is Clay, nice to meet you!  With five years of professional web development experience, I’m passionate about crafting innovative and effective digital solutions. My journey into the world of coding began as a late-blooming enthusiast, transitioning from a background in audio engineering and music. This shift allowed me to leverage my love for problem-solving and puzzles in the dynamic field of computer science. Currently, I work as a Full Stack web developer, where I enjoy tackling complex challenges and creating seamless user experiences. Outside of coding, I'm a dedicated husband, a vegan, and a proud dad to two lovable rescue pitbulls and two rescued rats. When I’m not immersed in code, you can find me experimenting with new vegan recipes, savoring a craft beer, or diving into my favorite video games.  Thanks for stopping by my portfolio—feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect or learn more about my work!",
